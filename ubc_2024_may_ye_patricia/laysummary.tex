The immune system is composed of many cells belonging to different immune cell types. These cells undergo complex, multi-step cellular processes to reach their mature state. Abnormalities in the function and balance of immune cells result in immune dysfunction, which can lead to immunological diseases. This thesis introduces a novel computational method to model the relationships between cell types involved in immune responses through their shared gene expression features. 

An application of this model on a dataset pertaining to systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disorder with no known cure, provides insights into the genetic mechanisms of this disease.
