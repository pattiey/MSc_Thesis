% This is the \documentclass[]{} command.  The manditory argument
% specifies the "flavour" of thesis (ubcthesis for UBC).  The
% optional arguments (in []) specify options that affect how the
% thesis is displayed.  Please see the ubcthesis documentation for
% details about the options.
\documentclass[msc,oneside]{ubcthesis}
%
% To compile this sample thesis, issue the following commands:
% latex ubcsample
% bibtex ubcsample
% latex ubcsample
% latex ubcsample
% latex ubcsample
%
% To view use xdvi (on unix systems):
% xdvi ubcsample.dvi
%
% To make a postscript file, use dvips:
% dvips -o ubcsample.ps ubcsample.dvi
%
% To view the postscript file, use ghostview or gv (on unix systems):
% gv ubcsample.ps
%
%************************************************
% Optional packages.
%
% The use of these packages is optional, but they provide various
% tools for more flexible formating.  The sample thesis uses these,
% but if you remove the example code, you should be able to exclude
% these packages.  Only standard packages have been described here;
% they should be installed with any complete LaTeX instalation, but
% if not, you can find them at the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network
% (CTAN): http://www.ctan.org/
%

%******** afterpage ***************************
% This package allows you to issue commands at the end of the current
% page.  A good use for this is to use the command
% \afterpage{\clearpage} right after a figure.  This will cause the
% figure to be inserted on the page following the current one (or on
% the current page if it will fit) but will not break the page in the
% middle.
\usepackage{afterpage}
\usepackage{tabularx,booktabs}
\usepackage{url}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{rotating}
\usepackage{adjustbox}
\usepackage{geometry}

%******** float *********************************
% This package allows you to customize the style of
% "floats"---floating objects such as figures and tables.  In
% addition, it allows you to define additional floating objects which
% may be included in a list similar to that produces by \listoftables
% and \listoffigures.  Common uses include introducing floats for
% programs and other code bits in Compute Science and Chemical Schema.
\usepackage{float}

%******** tocloft *******************************
% This package allows you to customize and define custom lists such
% as a list of programs or Chemical Scheme.  Note: if you use the
% subfigure package, you must specify that you do as an option here.
% The title option uses the default formatting.  We do not use this
% here as the default formatting is acceptable.  Use the float
% package instead unless you need the extra formatting control
% provided by tocloft.
%\usepackage[subfigure, titles]{tocloft}

%******** alltt *********************************
% The alltt package allows you to include files and have them
% formatted in a verbatim fashion.  This is useful for including
% source code from an additional file.
%\usepackage{alltt}

%******** listings ******************************
% The listings package may be used to include chunks of source code
% and has facilities for pretty-printing many languages.
%\usepackage{listings}

%******** longtable *****************************
% The longtable package allows you to define tables that span
% multiple pages.
\usepackage{longtable}

%******** graphics and graphicx *****************
% This allows you to include encapsulated postscript files.  If you
% don't have this, comment the \includegraphics{} line following the
% comment "%includegraphics" later in this file.
\usepackage{graphicx}

%******** subfigure *****************************
% The subfigure package allows you to include multiple figures and
% captions within a single figure environment.
%\usepackage{subfigure}

%******** here **********************************
% The here package gives you more control over the placement of
% figures and tables.  In particular, you can specify the placement
% "H" which means "Put the figure here" rather than [h] which means
% "I would suggest that you put the figure here if you think it looks
% good."
%\usepackage{here}

%******** pdflscape ********************************
% This allows you to include landscape layout pages by using the
% |landscape| environment.  The use of |pdflscape| is preferred over
% the standard |lscape| package because it automatically rotates the
% page in the pdf file for easier reading.  (Thanks to Joseph Shea
% for pointing this out.)
\usepackage{pdflscape}

%******** natbib ********************************
% This is a very nice package for bibliographies.  It includes options
% for sorting and compressing bibliographic entries.
\usepackage[numbers,sort&compress]{natbib}

%******** psfrag ******************************
% This allows you to replace text in postscript pictures with formated
% latex text.  This allows you to use math in graph labels
% etc. Uncomment the psfrag lines following the "%psfrag" comment
% later in this file if you don't have this package.  The replacements
% will only be visible in the final postscript file: they will be
% listed in the .dvi file but not performed.
\usepackage{psfrag}

%******** hyperref *****************************
% Please read the manual:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html
%
% This adds hyperlinks to your document: with the right viewers (later
% versions of xdvi, acrobat with pdftex, latex2html etc.) this will
% make your equation, figure, citation references etc. hyperlinks so
% that you can click on them.  Also, your table of contents will be
% able to take you to the appropriate sections.  In the viewers that
% support this, the links often appear with an underscore.  This
% underscore will not appear in printed versions.
%
% Note: if you do not use the hypertex option, then the dvips driver
% may be loaded by default.  This will cause the entries in the list
% of figures and list of tables to be on a single line because dvips
% does not deal with hyperlinks on broken lines properly.
%
% NOTE: HYPERREF is sensitive to the ORDER in which it is LOADED.
% For example, it must be loaded AFTER natbib but BEFORE newly
% defined float environments.  See the README file with the hyperref
% for some help with this.  If you have some very obscure errors, try
% first disabling hyperref.  If that fixes the problem, try various
% orderings.
%
% Note also that there is a bug with versions before 2003/11/30
% v6.74m that cause the float package to not function correctly.
% Please ensure you have a current version of this package.  A
% warning will be issued if you leave the date below but do not have
% a current version installed.
%
% Some notes on options: depending on how you build your files, you
% may need to choose the appropriate option (such as [pdftex]) for the
% backend driver (see the hyperref manual for a complete list).  Also,
% the default here is to make links from the page numbers in the table
% of contents and lists of figures etc.  There are other options:
% excluding the [linktocpage] option will make the entire text a
% hyperref, but for some backends will prevent the text from wrapping
% which can look terrible.  There is a [breaklinks=true] option that
% will be set if the backend supports (dvipdfm for example supports
% it but does not work with psfrag.)
%
% Finally, there are many options for choosing the colours of the
% links.  These will be included by default in future versions but
% you should probably consider changing some now for the electronic
% version of your thesis.
\usepackage[unicode=true,
  linktocpage,
  linkbordercolor={0.5 0.5 1},
  citebordercolor={0.5 1 0.5},
  linkcolor=blue]{hyperref}

% If you would like to compile this sample thesis without the
% hyperref package, then you will need to comment out the previous
% \usepackage command and uncomment the following command which will
% put the URL's in a typewriter font but not link them.
%\newcommand\url[1]{\texttt{#1}}

%******** setspace *******************************
% The setspace package allows you to manually set the spacing of the
% file.  UBC may require 1.5 spacing for microfilming of theses.  In
% this case you may obtain this by including this package and issuing
% one of the following commands:
\usepackage{setspace}
%\singlespacing
\onehalfspacing
%\doublespacing

% These commands are optional.  The defaults are shown.  You only
% need to include them if you need a different value
\institution{The University Of British Columbia}

% If you are at the Okanagan campus, then you should specify these
% instead.
%\faculty{The College of Graduate Studies}
%\institutionaddress{Okanagan}
\faculty{THE FACULTY OF GRADUATE AND POSTDOCTORAL STUDIES}
\institutionaddress{Vancouver}

% You can issue as many of these as you have...
\previousdegree{B.Sc., The University of British Columbia, 2021}

% You can override the option setting here.
% \degreetitle{Jack of All Trades}

% These commands are required.

I would like to the deepest gratitude towards my supervisors, Dr. Yongjin Park and Dr. Ramon Klein Geltink. Thank you for your ongoing support and the freedom to pursue my research interests through this project. You both believed in me and my ideas, even when I did not. You have taught me how to conduct research with integrity and inspired me to follow my curiosities. I am so thankful to have worked with the two of you and I can't wait to use everything that I have learned from you in my future endeavors. 

I would like to thank my committee members, Dr. Adi Steif and Dr. Geoffrey Schiebinger, for their support and valuable feedback on my work.

To the RKG lab, thank you for showing me how to pipette and letting me fool around with all your equipment. You are all such talented and ambitious scientists. I only wish that I had been able to spend more time in the lab with you.

To the Park lab, I am so grateful to have worked alongside people with such a wealth of knowledge and experience. I would like to thank Yichen Zhang in particular for providing much needed guidance on the conceptualization and implementation of my project. 

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their unconditional and unwavering love and support through this journey. To my mom, thank you for telling me not to become an engineer, this is way more fun. To the members of our mortgaged home, I don't know how I could have gotten through this without you guys by my side. You each inspire me in your own special ways and I love you.
